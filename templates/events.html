    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>NB!</strong> This is a <strong>new feature</strong>. Most of the games in the
    database have not been associated with an event, which is why this page looks very empty. This will happen over time,
    but it's a lengthy process. Please be patient with us. If you want to help, let me know at evfonn(at)gmail(dot)com.</p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">The events are organized in a hierarchical fashion. Thus, all GSL tournaments are filed
    under GSL, all Code S under their respective seasons, all groups under their respective Code S event, and so on.</p>
