<h2>Staff</h2>

<p>These are some of the people who make Aligulac possible. There is some delay in putting new contributors up
here, so it might not be 100% complete.</p>

<table style="width: 67em; border-style: none;">
<tr><td>
<h2>Eivind "TheBB" Fonn</h2>
<img src="http://static.aligulac.com/staff/thebb.jpeg" style="float: left; margin-right: 2em;" />
<p>TheBB is the head honcho of Aligulac. He conceived of the site, built the first version, and implemented
most of the features currently available. Nowadays, time is shorter, but he remains responsible for the rating
system and the inferences (predictions). He is also the server owner and the one paying for the upkeep.</p>
<p>TheBB is Norwegian, but has spent his last four years in the flowery fields of Switzerland.</p>

<h2>C. "Conti" Kolbe</h2>
<img src="http://static.aligulac.com/male.png" style="float: left; margin-right: 2em;" />
<p>Together with Grovbolle, Conti was the first to join the team. He has made innumerable contributions to the
database, with the second most matches added, and together with Grovbolle and kiekaboe basically created the
event catalogue from scratch. However, Conti is also the man to thank for several features on the site,
primarily earnings, team transfers, and several other minor enhancements.</p>

<h2>Morten "Grovbolle" JÃ¸rgensen</h2>
<img src="http://static.aligulac.com/staff/grovbolle.jpeg" style="float: left; margin-right: 2em;" />
<p>Grovbolle is one of the earliest contributors. After working a lot with the database maintenance in the
beginning, he has now moved to more of a public relations role. Today he spends most of his time tweeting
obscenities and the occasional useful factoid from <a href="http://twitter.com/Sc2Aligulac">@Sc2Aligulac</a>.
He also recruits new volunteers and tries to keep them from blowing the site up.</p>
<p>Grovbolle is Danish, and has just completed his Bachelor thesis in Business Administration and Information
Technology.</p>

<tr><td>
<h2>Tom "kiekaboe" van Vliet</h2>
<img src="http://static.aligulac.com/male.png" style="float: left; margin-right: 2em;" />
<p>Nobody has added more matches than kiekaboe. Man or machine? Does it really matter? Whatever he is,
we can thank him for thousands of matches added, probably tens of thousands catalogued, and innumerable
conflicts and inconsistencies resolved. The database would not have been the same without him.</p>
<p>One of the first to join the operation, kiekaboe remains active to this day.</p>
</td></tr>

<tr><td>
<h2>William "Inflicted"</h2>
<img src="http://static.aligulac.com/male.png" style="float: left; margin-right: 2em;" />
<p>Inflicted is a long time database maintainer, and an even longer time Liquipedia contributor who joined the
team in January 2013. As our only Aussie member, he is often the one adding SEA results.</p>
<p>His encyclopedic knowledge of Liquipedia and TLPD come in handy when conflicts or inconsistencies are
discovered.</p>
