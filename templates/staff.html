<h2>Staff</h2>

<p>These are some of the people who make Aligulac possible. There is some delay in putting new contributors up
here, so it might not be 100% complete.</p>

<table style="width: 67em; border-style: none;">

<h2>Eivind "TheBB" Fonn</h2>
<img src="http://static.aligulac.com/staff/thebb.jpeg" style="float: left; margin-right: 2em;" />
<p>TheBB is the head honcho of Aligulac. He conceived of the site, built the first version, and implemented
most of the features currently available. Nowadays, time is shorter, but he remains responsible for the rating
system and the inferences (predictions). He is also the server owner and the one paying for the upkeep.</p>
<p>TheBB is Norwegian, but has spent his last four years in the flowery fields of Switzerland.</p>
